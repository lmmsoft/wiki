Here's an explanation of each column in the top output:
- PID: The process ID of the process. This is a unique number used to identify a running process.
- USER: The username of the user that owns the process.
- PR: 优先级 Priority of the process. A higher number means higher priority.
- NI: Nice value of the process. A higher value means lower priority. NI is used to adjust the PR priority up or down.
- VIRT: 虚拟内存 Total amount of virtual memory used by the process (in KB). Includes memory that has been swapped out.
- RES: 常驻内存 Resident memory used by the process (in KB). Includes only memory that is physically in RAM.
- SHR: 共享内存 Shared memory used by the process (in KB).
- S: 状态 Process status. D is uninterruptible sleep, R is running, S is sleeping, T is traced/stopped, Z is defunct/zombie.
- %CPU: 单核百分比 Percentage of CPU time used by the process. A value of 1.0 means the process is using 100% of one CPU core.
- %MEM: 总内存百分比 Percentage of total system memory used by the process.
- TIME+: CPU总时间 Total CPU time used by the process. In the format HOURS:MINUTES:SECONDS.
- COMMAND: The command that launched the process. In this case, python3.11.
So in summary, these columns give you a wealth of information about the CPU/memory usage, status, ownership, and identity of all running processes on a Linux system. Let me know if you have any other questions!
